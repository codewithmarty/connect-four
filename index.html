        <h2>Connect Four</h2>
        <p>Connect Four is a two-player strategy game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The first player to connect four discs of their color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.</p>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The game is played on a vertical grid with six rows and seven columns.</li>
          <li>Players take turns dropping colored discs into the grid, starting with the first player.</li>
          <li>Discs are dropped into a column from the top, and will stack on top of each other in that column.</li>
          <li>The first player to connect four discs of their color in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.</li>
